# Send a message with failover

In this example you will send a Facebook Messenger message that fails over to sending an SMS. In the Workflow object message objects can be placed in any order to suit your use case. Each message object must contain a failover object, except for the last message, as there are no more message objects to failover to.

Key | Description
-- | --
`NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID` | The ID of the application that you created.
`FROM_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message from in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. For example `447700900000`.
`SENDER_ID` | Your sender ID. This value should be the `to.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event.
`RECIPIENT_ID` | The recipient ID is the Facebook user you are messaging. This value should be the `from.id` value you received in the inbound messenger event. It is sometimes called the PSID.
