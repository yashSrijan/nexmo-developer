# Retrieve information for a call

A building block that shows how to retrieve information for a call. The call
to retrieve information for is identified via a UUID.

## Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key |	Description
-- | --
`UUID` | The UUID for the call for which information is being requested.


```building_blocks
source: '_examples/voice/retrieve-info-for-a-call'
```

## Try it out

You will need to:

1. Set up a call and obtain the call UUID. You could use the 'connect an inbound call' building block to do this.
2. Retrieve information for the call (this building block).
