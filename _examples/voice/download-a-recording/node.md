## Implement a webhook

```code
config: voice.download-recording.node
```

## Run your server

Save this file to your machine and run it using the `node` command:

```
$ node app.js
```

You'll need to expose your server to the open internet. During development you can use a tool like [Ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/) to do that.
